**Focus:** React fundamentals and environment setup

### ✅ Work Completed  
- Learned what React is and how JSX enables dynamic UI rendering.  
- Set up the project using Vite for fast development workflows.  
- Created initial components (`App.jsx`, `Title.jsx`) and structured the project.

### 🧠 Insights  
- React’s declarative style makes building UI components intuitive.  
- Vite’s hot module replacement improves developer experience.  
- Starting with reusable components lays the foundation for scalable apps.

### 🚀 Next Steps  
- Explore component composition with props and lists.  
- Implement reusable UI elements such as `Product` and `ProductTab`.

**Focus:** Component design patterns and state handling preparation

### ✅ Work Completed  
- Created `Product` and `ProductTab` components to render product lists.  
- Used JSX curly braces for embedding dynamic content.  
- Applied conditional rendering to handle out-of-stock products.

### 🧠 Insights  
- Structuring components improves readability and reuse.  
- Handling props dynamically enables data-driven rendering.  
- React fragments and lists are essential for complex UI structures.

### 🚀 Next Steps  
- Add state management with `useState`.  
- Implement event handling for user interactions like “Add to Cart”.

**Focus:** Styling, developer tools, and real-world activity implementation

### ✅ Work Completed  
- Applied dynamic styling patterns to components.  
- Integrated React Developer Tools to inspect component structure.  
- Built activity pages such as “Amazon Cards” to practice layout and responsiveness.

### 🧠 Insights  
- Developer tools accelerate debugging and component analysis.  
- Styling patterns with CSS enhance user experience and visual consistency.  
- Breaking tasks into smaller activities reinforces learning.

### 🚀 Next Steps  
- Expand state management and interaction logic.
