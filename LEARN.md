### ðŸš€ Work Completed

- React entry point is `index.html` + `main.jsx`.

**Focus:** Components, Props & JSX Patterns  

### ðŸš€ Work Completed  
- Built `Title` component (expressions + props).  
- Added `Product` and `ProductTab` components.

- Added conditional rendering for stock.  

### ðŸ§  Insights  
- Components = independent + reusable.  
- JSX curly braces allow inline JS logic.  
- Lists require unique keys.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps  
- Add `useState` for cart management.  
- Implement "Add to Cart" button.
