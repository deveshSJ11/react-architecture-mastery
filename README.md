# ðŸ“¦ React Architecture Mastery

A hands-on learning repository focused on building scalable and maintainable React applications using modern tools like Vite, JSX, and state management patterns.

## ðŸ“– About This Journey  
This is a part of my structured learning journey where I explore advanced React concepts, component design patterns, dynamic rendering, and styling techniques. Each feature is documented with daily logs and reflections to reinforce best practices.

## ðŸš€ Features Implemented So Far  
âœ” Environment setup with Vite for fast development  
âœ” Reusable components (`Title`, `Product`, `ProductTab`)  
âœ” JSX expressions, props, and conditional rendering  
âœ” Dynamic styling and responsive layouts  
âœ” Developer tools integration for debugging  
âœ” Structured documentation with learning logs and changelog  
âœ” Refactored ProductTab to handle dynamic product data  
âœ” Applied mobile-first responsive patterns for Amazon Cards  
âœ” Introduced interactivity with event handling (clicks, non-clicks, Event Object)
âœ” Learned and applied `useState` hook for managing component state
